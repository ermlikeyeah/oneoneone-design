          <div class="conditionContainer"><img class="conditionImage" src="/public/images/conditions/wart-1-600.jpg"><br />Warts feel firm and rough. They can appear on palms, knuckles, knees and fingers.</div>

          <div class="conditionContainer"><img class="conditionImage" src="/public/images/conditions/wart-2-600.jpg"><br />Warts on your feet are called verrucas. They have tiny black dots under the hard skin and can be painful - like standing on a needle.</div>

          <div class="conditionContainer"><img class="conditionImage" src="/public/images/conditions/wart-3-600.jpg"><br />Some warts are round, flat and can be yellow (plane warts). You can have many of them.</div>

          <div class="conditionContainer"><img class="conditionImage" src="/public/images/conditions/wart-4-600.jpg"><br />Clusters of warts, spread over an area of skin (mosaic warts) are common on feet and hands.</div>


          <h2 class="heading-large">Warts often go away on their own</h2>

          <p>You don’t need to do anything about warts. They’ll usually go away
             within 2 years.</p>

           <p>Warts don’t cause you any harm. They might itch or bleed but it doesn’t
             mean there’s a problem.</p>

           <p>If you are unsure or worried about a growth on your skin you should see
             your GP. </p>

           <h2 class="heading-large">Treating warts that are bothering you</h2>

           <p>You can treat warts if they’re bothering you, they keep coming back or
             they’re painful.</p>

           <h3 class="heading-medium">Treatments from your pharmacy</h3>

           <p>You can buy creams, plasters and sprays from pharmacies to get rid of
             warts. These treatments can take up to 3 months, they can irritate your
             skin and they don’t always work.</p>

           <p>Ask your pharmacist for advice on what to use if you have a condition
             such as diabetes.</p>

             <p></p>


           <p class="alert-orange">
             Don’t use pharmacy treatments on your face. See your GP instead.
           </p>

           <h3 class="heading-medium">Treatment from your GP</h3>

           <p>Your GP may be able to freeze warts off. If the wart is big, it may
             take more than one session. After treatment, the wart should fall off a few
             weeks later.</p>

           <p>Check with your GP if the NHS pays for this treatment in your area.</p>

           <p>If treatment hasn’t worked or you have a wart on your face, your GP might
             refer you to a skin specialist. Other treatments include minor surgery and
             treatment with laser or light.</p>

           <h2 class="heading-large">How to stop warts spreading</h2>

           <ul class="list-bullet">
             <li>wash your hands after touching a wart</li>
             <li>don’t bite your nails or suck your fingers with warts on</li>
             <li>change your socks daily if you have verrucas</li>
             <li>avoid cutting warts when shaving</li>
             <li>don’t share towels</li>
             <li>cover warts and verrucas with a plaster when swimming</li>
           </ul>
